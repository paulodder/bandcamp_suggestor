* intro
Code to suggest a track based on Bandcamp user's wishlist and
https://bc-explorer.app
* setting up
Make a =virtualenv=, I used python3.10, and inside it install requirements:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC
and then:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install -e .
#+END_SRC
* usage
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from src.bandcamp_suggestor import BandcampSuggestor
bc_suggestor = BandcampSuggestor('<bandcamp_username>')
bc_suggestor.generate_suggestion()
#+END_SRC
will scrape the wishlist items from bandcamp, use a randomly picked one to feed
to bc-explorer, and then randomly picks a suggestion by bc-explorer.
