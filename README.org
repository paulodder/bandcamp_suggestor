* intro
Code to suggest a track based on Bandcamp user's wishlist and
https://bc-explorer.app
* setting up
1. Make a =virtualenv=, I used python3.9, and inside it install requirements \\
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   #+END_SRC

   and then:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pip install -e .
   #+END_SRC

2. Create a =.env= file \\
   A =.env= file is used to keep track of machine-specific variables. Create a
   =.env= in the root of this project with the following values set:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sh
   PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/bandcamp_suggestor/ # the path to this directory
   BANDCAMP_USER=username # your bandcamp username
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   To access these variables in python code run:
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   from decouple import config
   config("PROJECT_DIR")
   #+END_SRC
* usage
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from src.bandcamp_suggestor import BandcampSuggestor
bc_suggestor = BandcampSuggestor('<bandcamp_username>')
bc_suggestor.generate_suggestions()
#+END_SRC
will scrape the wishlist items from bandcamp, use a randomly picked one to feed
to bc-explorer, and then returns suggestions from bc-explorer.
